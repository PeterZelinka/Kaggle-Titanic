## Introduction

## Datasets

The data is divided into two datasets train.csv and test.csv. The former contains data about passengers including whether they have survived or not (the ground truth). The latter on the other hand contains the same features except for the survived column. The information in test.csv will be used to make prediction that are submitted to Kaggle.

### Variables:
- PassengerID (ID of the passenger)
- Survived 1  (Survived 0 - Did not survive)
